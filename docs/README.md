# C2F-W Code Documentation
## TL;DR
The Doxigen generated files will be saved to the docs directory.
```
sudo apt install doxygen graphviz
cd C2F-W/docs
doxygen Doxyfile
firefox html/index.html
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Doxygen installed on your system. You can find installation instructions in the [official Doxygen documentation](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html).

## Generating the documentation

Go to the `docs` directory and run the command `doxygen Doxyfile`. The generated HTML files will be stored in that same directory. You can open the main file `html/index.html` using your favorite browser (firefox).
